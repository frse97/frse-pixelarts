This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Introduction
This Project was made based on an [article](https://dev.to/jnschrag/creating-pixel-art-with-css-3451) i found on [Dev.To](https://dev.to/) about creating Pixelart with Scss and Box-Shadows. Thanks to [jnschrag](https://dev.to/jnschrag) for the inspiration.
In next steps i want to try to analyse images and transform pixels into arrays to create dynamic box-shadows in styled components.
